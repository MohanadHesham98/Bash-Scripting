##  What is Shell Scripting?

Shell scripting is writing a sequence of Linux commands in a file to be executed automatically, instead of typing them manually every time. It's especially useful for:

-  **Save Time** â€“ Automate repetitive command sequences  
-  **Reduce Errors** â€“ Ensure consistent execution  
-  **Simplify Complexity** â€“ Combine multiple commands into one executable  
-  **Reusable Code** â€“ Write once, use anytime
