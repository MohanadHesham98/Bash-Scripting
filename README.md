## 📜 What is Shell Scripting?

Shell scripting is writing a sequence of Linux commands in a file to be executed automatically, instead of typing them manually every time. It's especially useful for:

- 🕒 **Save Time** – Automate repetitive command sequences  
- ✅ **Reduce Errors** – Ensure consistent execution  
- ⚙️ **Simplify Complexity** – Combine multiple commands into one executable  
- ♻️ **Reusable Code** – Write once, use anytime
